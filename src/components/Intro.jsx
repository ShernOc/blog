             <h3>RECAP TIME </h3>
             <p>Well we have learnt a lot one Now 1. To create a React component, We can create components with  function and return jsx syntax like code. 2. There are <b>Imports </b> and <b>Exports </b> That allows one to move/reuse and access variable and function within the entire application or project and 3. We have rules in React, such a. Return multiple elements wrapped in a single div tag or fragment tag. b. Have all the JSX tag be closed and c. Have ClassName be in Camelcase and Javascript functions should start in small letter to differentiate with React functions.
             <br />
             This is mind blowing, and i Cant Wait till I learn how to now have Javascript function be integrated into the System or the work flow. </p>
        </div>
