        <p>
                This is supposed to be my first time being able to use <span>React</span>. I believe that Coding is very easy if you fully understand the syntax and the meaning behind what you are doing or understand the code. This is not about what i believe in but i want to share My notes as i study React. Majority of what i will be sharing are from the <b><a href="https://flatironschool.com/">FLATIRON SCHOOL</a></b>  and <b><a href="https://moringaschool.com/">MORINGA SCHOOL</a></b>.
                It took a while to  say the above so lets say <span>Yeah an proud of myself.</span>
                What i have discovered, is that react is in my own words is a combination of JavaScript and lots of HTML code syntax, working together to create incredible application. I hope that throughout the reading, you get to appreciate the two pairs. Also, if you understand JS, well and HTML, come along and let us all learn to code using REACT!.

                It is difficult to express this but YES i am proficient in this languages and JS programme.
