                REACT COMPONENTS
            </h2>
            <p>
            <b>What are React Components?</b> React component are functions, and to  create a react component function, we have to  create and name it, and return a jsx syntax like code.
            Within the components here are <b>Imports </b> and <b>Exports </b> that allows one to move/reuse and access functions within the entire application or project.
            Also there are rules in React, such as: (a.) Returning multiple elements wrapped in a single div tag or fragment tag. (b.) Have all the JSX tag be closed and (c.) Have ClassName be in Camelcase and Javascript functions should start in small letter to differentiate with React functions. 
            This is mind blowing, and i cant wait till I learn how to
            implement Javascript dynamic functionality in React.</p>
